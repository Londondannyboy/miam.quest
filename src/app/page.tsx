// Expanded FAQ data targeting ranking keywords
const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is a MIAM?",
    answer: "A MIAM (Mediation Information Assessment Meeting) is a mandatory meeting with an accredited family mediator that you must attend before applying to family court in England and Wales. During this 45-60 minute session, a mediator explains the mediation process, assesses your situation, and determines if mediation is suitable for your case. MIAMs are required under the Children and Families Act 2014."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a MIAM certificate?",
    answer: "A MIAM certificate is an official document issued by an FMC-accredited mediator after you've attended your MIAM. This certificate is required when submitting a C100 form to family court. It confirms you've explored mediation as an alternative to court proceedings. The certificate can state that mediation was attempted, not suitable, or that the other party refused to participate."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a MIAM certificate for court?",
    answer: "A MIAM certificate for court is proof that you've fulfilled the legal requirement to attend a Mediation Information Assessment Meeting before applying for a child arrangements order. Courts will not process your C100 application without this certificate or evidence of a valid MIAM exemption. The certificate shows you've considered mediation before pursuing court action."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a MIAM before going to court?",
    answer: "Yes, in most cases you must attend a MIAM before submitting a C100 form to apply for a child arrangements order in England and Wales. This is a legal requirement. However, you may qualify for a MIAM exemption if there's domestic abuse, child protection concerns, urgency, or other specific circumstances."
  },
  {
    question: "What is MIAM mediation?",
    answer: "MIAM mediation refers to the family mediation process that begins with a Mediation Information Assessment Meeting. After the initial MIAM, if both parties agree, you can proceed to full mediation sessions where a neutral mediator helps you reach agreements about child arrangements, finances, and property without going to court. MIAM mediation is often faster and less expensive than court proceedings."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a MIAM cost?",
    answer: "A MIAM typically costs £90-150 per person for a single session. However, you may qualify for free mediation through legal aid if you're on a low income or receive certain benefits. The Family Mediation Voucher Scheme also provides up to £500 towards mediation costs for eligible families."
  },
  {
    question: "What exemptions allow me to skip the MIAM?",
    answer: "You may be exempt from attending a MIAM if: there's evidence of domestic abuse, child protection concerns exist, there's urgency or risk of harm, the other party is overseas or in prison, you've attended a MIAM in the last 4 months, you have a disability preventing attendance, or you cannot locate the other party. You'll need to provide evidence of your exemption."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Miam (the AI) issue a MIAM certificate?",
    answer: "No. Only FMC-accredited human mediators can issue valid MIAM certificates. Miam the AI assistant helps you prepare for your MIAM meeting and mediation - making the process easier, less stressful, and more effective. We help you organize your thoughts and understand what to expect."
  },
  {
    question: "Is using MIAM.quest free?",
    answer: "Yes! Preparing with Miam is completely free. We help you organize your thoughts, understand the MIAM process, and prepare for your actual MIAM meeting with a human mediator. There's no cost to chat with our AI assistant."
  },
  {
    question: "How long is a MIAM certificate valid?",
    answer: "A MIAM certificate is valid for 4 months from the date it was issued. If you don't submit your court application within this timeframe, you may need to attend another MIAM and obtain a new certificate. It's important to proceed with your application promptly after receiving your certificate."
